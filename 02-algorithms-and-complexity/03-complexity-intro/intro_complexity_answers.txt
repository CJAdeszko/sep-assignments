1. Describe an analogy for relating an algorithm that has efficiency O(1) and another algorithm that has O(2n).

  O(1) - Tesla Roadster
  O(2n) - Nissan Leaf

2. In plain English, what is the best case scenario for binary search?

  The item we are searching for is the first item the algorithm checks.

3. In plain English, what is the worst-case scenario for binary search?

  The algorithm has to look at half of the items in the data.

4. In plain English, what is the bounded-case scenario for binary search?

  The algorithm has to look at more than one item but less than half of the items.
  
5. What is the limit of the function above as n approaches infinity?

  infinity

6. What is the Big-O of an algorithm that has the data points above?

  O(2^n)

7. Write a Ruby method that takes a number n. This method must print the worst-case number of iterations
for linear search to find an item in collections of size one to n.
Use it to generate a table of worst-case iterations of collections up to size 10.
Create a graph from the output using Google Sheets or other graphing software.
Analyze the graph and denote its Big-O somewhere on the graph.

8. What is the Big-O of binary search?

  O(log n)

9. What is the Big-Ω of binary search?

  O(1)

10. What is the Big-Ө of binary search?

  O(log n)
