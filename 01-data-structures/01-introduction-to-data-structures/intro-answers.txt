1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

Both the line and screen data structures allow developers to access and manipulate data through arrays. Line is a simple array
of strings which allows developers to easily add new strings to the end of the array using line.join(person), remove members
using line.leave(person), or find a specific person in line using line.search(person). The screen data structure is a two-dimensional
array which allows developers to model a screen by inserting pixels at specified x,y coordinates using screen.insert(x,y)
or find the pixel at a specified coordinate using screen.at(x,y).

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

Line allows developers to find a specific person using line.search(person) which utilizes the private method line.index(person).
Line.index() returns the index of the string that was searched for and allows developers to return the string at that index in
the line.members array. Screen uses screen.at(x,y) to find the pixel at the specified x,y coordinate. If the x,y coordinate
provided is within the dimensions of the screen, screen.at() will return the pixel data.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

The line data structure is analogous to a queue in online gaming. When a user sends a request to enter a game, they are placed in
a queue. The queue is first in, first out and a user can cancel the request to join (line.leave()). The screen data structure
could also represent a digital picture. A digital picture could also be modeled as a two-dimensional array with specific
pixel information at specific coordinates.
